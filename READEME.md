# Buy Buttcoins

Press a button and get Buttcoins!

This was a joke project based off of an [old Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/9clh2k/trying_to_build_a_coin_using_css_lazy_or/).* In particular:

> I’m pretty sure you can use CSS to code up a “Buy buttcoins” button that changes into a red blinking 40 point Comic Sans “SFYL” when you click it, which is mostly indistinguishable from the real thing.

I tried doing that with this project. Sadly I had to use some JS so this is not a pure CSS program.
